Old recommendation way:

Actually The recommendation is done with the following steps :

- Take the actors best movie in the Db and look the movie in TMDB API and give similar movie to this movie.
- Take the Directors best movie in the Db and look the movie in TMDB API and give similar movie to this movie.
- Take the films the user selected and look the movie in TMDB API and give similar movie to all movies.
- Then apply a filter for the movie length, then apply a filter for Freshness, then apply a filter for genre and display 10 best results


New recommendation way:
Now I want to make it work differently :

- For each actor take 3-4 random movies they have done and get similar movies using the API.
- For each Director, take 3-4 random movies and get similar movies using API
- Then make a list with all actors and directors similar movies
- For each movies the user select takes similar movies.
- Then cross the list from actors and directors and user selected similar movies and take the common movies in the list.
- Then apply a filter for the movie length, then apply a filter for Freshness, then apply a filter for genre and display 10 best results
